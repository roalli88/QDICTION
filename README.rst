About
=====
**QDiction** is a lightweight minimal dictionary based on wordnet. Search results are classified (where appropriate) as antonyms,
synonyms or related words.


Installation
============
On a linux computer with python3.6+ and pip, installation is as simple as running "pip install qdiction" with permissions.

Usage
=====
After a successful installation simply launch **"qdiction"** from a linux terminal.


Useful information
==================

On the first run qdiction will download the "wordnet" file and save
it in the user's home directory. It will be installed in a folder
named "nltk_data". Therefore, if you later wish to uninstall
qdiction, **first** use
"pip uninstall qdiction" or "pip3 uninstall qdiction" and **second** remove the nltk_data folder from
your home directory.
